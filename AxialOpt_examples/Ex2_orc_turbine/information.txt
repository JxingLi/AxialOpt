AxialOpt examples â€“ Organic Rankine Cylce (ORC) turbine

This example uses the thermodynamic boundary conditions for a 1-stage turbine using R125 as working fluid

The data was obtained from:
Macchi and Astolfi (2017). Organic Rankine Cycles Power Systems 1st Edition. Page 314

Thermodynamic data:
Working fluid	                    R125
Inlet stagnation temperature	155 C
Inlet stagnation pressure	3618.0 kPa
Outlet static pressure	1568.5 kPa
Isentropic power output	250 kW

Observations:
This case corresponds to a transcritical Rankine cycle with a condenser temperature of 30 C

AxialOpt examples â€“ High pressure steam turbine

This example uses the thermodynamic boundary conditions for a 4-stage turbine using steam as working fluid

The data was obtained from the textbook example:
Moran and Shapiro(2011). Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics 7th Edition. Page 449

Thermodynamic data:
Working fluid	                    Water
Inlet stagnation temperature	480 C
Inlet stagnation pressure	80 bar
Outlet static pressure	7 bar
Mass flow rate      	65.64 kg/s

Observations:
This case corresponds to the high-pressure turbine of a steam power cycle with reheating
High-pressure steam turbines are characterized by short, shrouded blades with high hub-to-tip ratios whereas low-pressure steam turbines are characterized by long, unshrouded blades with low hub-to-tip ratios

AxialOpt examples â€“ Gas turbine

This example uses the thermodynamic boundary conditions of the 4-stage Westinghouse 501 gas turbine (year 1993).

The data was obtained from:
Saravanamuttoo, Rogers and Cohen (2009). Gas Turbine Theory 6th Edition. Page 45

Thermodynamic data:
Working fluid	                    Nitrogen
Inlet stagnation temperature	1533 K
Inlet stagnation pressure	14.6 bar
Outlet static pressure	1.00 bar
Mass flow rate	                    435 kg/s
Angular speed	                    3000 rpm

Observations:
The angular speed is fixed to 3000 rpm (connection to the grid)
Nitrogen was used as working fluid, although it would be more realistic to use air of a mixture of combustion gases.
Nitrogen was used because the computational cost of REFPROP function calls when using mixtures is significantly higher than that for pure substances (at least an order of magnitude)
This limitation may be addressed in the future if the option to compute the thermodynamic properties using look-up tables is added to the code.

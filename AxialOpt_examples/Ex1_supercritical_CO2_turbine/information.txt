AxialOpt examples â€“ Supercritical Carbon Dioxide turbine

This example uses the thermodynamic boundary conditions for a turbine using carbon dioxide as working fluid

The data was obtained from the textbook example:
Dostal (2014). A Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Cycle for Next Generation Nuclear Reactors. PhD thesis. Pages 227-228

Thermodynamic data:
Number of stages                        1
Working fluid	                    CO2
Inlet stagnation temperature	550 C
Inlet stagnation pressure	19827 kPa
Outlet static pressure	7901 kPa
Mass flow rate      	3209 kg/s

Observations:
The turbomachinery for supercritical CO2 power systems is characterized by (compared to steam turbines):
1) Compact sizes for the same power outputs (due to the higher density of the fluid)
2) Much lower number of states (due to the lower pressure ratio and enthalpy drop for a given temperature difference between heat source and sink)

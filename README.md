# AxialOpt
AxialOpt is a mean-line model for the optimization of axial turbines with any number of stages allows to use arbitrary equations of state and loss models. The model is documented in a peer-reviewed, open-access publication [1] and the source code is also stored in a Zenodo repository [2].


## Requisites
AxialOpt was implemented in MATLAB R2018a [3] and requires a REFPROP v9.1 installation [4] (see instructions).


## Instructions
* Just run the script [`AxialOpt_demo.m`](AxialOpt/Examples/AxialOpt_demo.m) to get started!
* The folder [refprop-matlab](AnnularDiffuser1D/refprop-matlab) contains a short guide about how to link REFPROP with MATLAB.
